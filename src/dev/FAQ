Why do the functions have a "-." in their comment block?
- Ask doxygen. The first part of documentation is in the .h file, so doxygen
  throws away the "brief" part in the corresponding .c file.
	We need to have an empty sentence.

How to run the tests?
- Simple case: "make run-tests".
- Running some tests: "make run-tests TEST_LIST=001*"
- Running with valgrind: "make run-tests CHECKER=valgrind". It's strongly
	recommended to use TEST_LIST and test only single calls.

What about gcov?
- Configure with "--enable-debug --enable-gcov"; compile with make.
  Start a clean environment with "make gcov-clean".
	Start one or more tests.
	Look at the summary with "make gcov"; the details are in <file>.gcov, and
	per-file summaries in <file>.gcov.smry. Example: "fsvs.c.gcov.smry".
