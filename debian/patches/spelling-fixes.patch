 A file with a changed size can immediately be known as changed; but if only the modification time is changed, this is not so easy. Per default FSVS does a MD5 check on the file in this case; if you don't want that, or if you want to do the checksum calculation for \fBevery\fP file (in case a file has changed, but its mtime not), you can use this option to change FSVS' behaviour.
