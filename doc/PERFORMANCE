- Program size is 280kB with debug information, 96kB without.
  Needed libraries not counted.
	Some debug code could be eliminated by "configure --enable-release".

- Initial checkin can take a while - there's a lot of data to transfer.

- memory usage: my test machine with 150000 files never grew 
  over 34MB in memory usage.
  (That is, with apr_pool_destroy(); with apr_pool_clean() I had to kill
  the process at 170MB)

- The fsfs backend makes two files out of one date file - one for meta-data
  (properties) and one for the real file-data.
  So 300000 files are created for a commit of 130000 files. 
	** On ext3 enable dir_index ** (see "tune2fs", "fsck.ext3 -D") or use bdb.

- "fsvs status" is (on cold caches) faster than "find"!

- testing goes much faster if you create a /tmp/ram directory and mount a
  tmpfs there. *** DO NOT USE ramfs !!! *** ramfs doesn't update the
	directory modification time on file creations, so fsvs won't work.
