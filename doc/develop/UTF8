UTF8 in FSVS
------------


Some points which trouble me a bit, and some random thoughts; everything
connected with UTF-8:

- Properties we get from the repository might be easiest stored locally 
  as UTF8, if we don't do anything with them (eg. svn:entry).

- In which properties can be non-ASCII-characters? Does someone define
  user/group names in UTF-8? Can eg. xattr have Unicode characters in them?
	Does that happen in practical usage?

- The currently used properties should be safe. I've never heard from
  non-ASCII groups or users, and the mtime should always be in the same
	format.

- I thought whether I should just do *everything* in UTF-8.
  But that is a performance trade off; on a simple "fsvs status" we'd 
	have to all filenames from the waa-directory. It may not be much work,
	but if it's not necessary ...

- I'd like to have the subversion headers to define a utf8_char *, which
  would (with gcc) be handled distinct from a normal char * ...
	(see linux kernel, include/linux/types.h: #define __bitwise ...)
	But that won't happen, as there's already too much software which relies
	on the current definitions.
