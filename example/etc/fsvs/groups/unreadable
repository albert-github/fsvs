# This is an example for a FSVS group definition file.
# See fsvs(1) for more details.
#
# This file is used for unreadable files, ie. files without the others-read 
# bit set.
# There are two main choices for them:
#  - ignore them
#  - or keep them versioned, but encrypted.
 

# As long as the "ignore" line is present, the entries will be ignored.
ignore

# If you want to encrypt the data, you have to change the example key-ID to 
# the one you want to use.
