Changes since 1.1.10
- New option debug_output; if it starts with a "|", the string is taken
  as a command.
- New authentication handling; should help for http:// and https://, 
  if passwords are required.
- Compatibility fix for https-URLs and update - we get a call with 
  data=NULL.
- Compatibility fix for http and https - doesn't like SVN_INVALID_REVNUM
  in svn_ra_get_log().
- First attempt at finding duplicate files; but FSVS doesn't do anything with 
	that information yet (just reports).
	- identical files by MD5
	- renamed files by inode
- Small documentation updates and fixes.
- Rewrote some internal parts for more clarity.
- Other fixes and cleanups.
- "copy"/"move" commands; old renamed to "copyfrom-detect".
- Defined copyfrom relations used on commit.
- Properties can now be removed - prop-del.
- Bugfix for very long filenames on NFS directories that give the number of
  entries as directory size.
- Documentation updates.
- Fix for copyfrom-detect: take all known entries as source, not only the 
	current arguments.
- Bugfix for device ignores - uninitialized variable. Thank you, valgrind!
- Optionally use valgrind in the tests - CHECKER=valgrind; and some 
	suppressions for my debian machine.

Changes since 1.1.9
- Bugfix for multi-URL-operation with separated repositories - use the 
	correct revision numbers.
- Bugfix for directories in $FSVS_WAA - create only needed ones.
	But that also means that the (local) property storage changed to UTF8, 
	where the names previously were stored in local encoding!
	Currently non-ASCII-property names are broken!  (Tell me if you need 
	"süch_nämes" - for -get and/or -list??)
- Memory leak in revert fixed - now really.
- Bugfix for cs__compare_file() ("st -C", "update", "commit" ...) - didn't 
	recover into a zero-block after a few non-zero characters (was slow).
- Changed the internal ignore -- from $FSVS_WAA to $FSVS_WAA/*.
	That allows to have $FSVS_WAA versioned (as it's needed), but reliably 
	ignore entries below. (Still via inode numbers, so still fast.)
- Bugfix for master/local operation, when dir from URL1 gets a new entry, 
	which should be committed in URL2 -- so the directory has to be created 
	in URL2.
- Various small fixes and cleanups.
- Using -q caused *more* output on errors.
- Bugfix for duplicate URL names.
- Error messages for invalid URL input now user-friendlier.
- Support for "log -v", to show filenames
- Removed the usleep() in the encoder loops (fsvs:update-pipe, 
	fsvs:commit-pipe). 
	For a 10MB file, encoder=cat: old time 7.1sec, new 0.33sec; using "dd 
	bs=1024k" gets it down to 0.3sec (cat uses only a 1024 bytes buffer).
- Properties may no longer be set on unknown entries.
- Property changes showed in status as "...." - now they get displayed in 
	the meta-data column(s).
- Status output changed; in certain cases (much too often) a "n" instead of 
	"N" would be printed. Now corrected.
- Bugfix for "-f text" - if a directory structure was removed, the child 
	wouldn't see the parent removed.
- Output beautification for sync-repos - use "" or the wc-path given on the 
	command line, don't simply print the full path.

Changes since 1.1.8
- Documentation updates
- Additional warning for vanishing entries
- New option "colordiff"
- New option "dir-sort" for "status" action.
- New option "status-coloring"; off per default.
- Small bugfixes and cleanups.
- Component-tests extended.
- Bugfix: the mtime for directories was not restored on uptime.
- Fix for "sync-repos" printing the root directory twice.
- Fix for sync-repos - if entries had no meta-data-properties set in the 
	repository we take the local values, if they exist. 
- Memory leak in big recursive reverts fixed -- at least I hope that I got 
	it.
- En/decoded entries (see fsvs:commit-pipe) now send another property - 
	fsvs:original-md5.
- $WAA_CONF/*/config is now read, too.
- Bugfix for "fsvs log" - endless loop, if the log message ends in a 
	character >= \x80.
- Bugfix for newly added files - on their first commit only an empty file 
	(0 bytes length) was sent; subsequent commits were ok. Thank you, Ben.
- Bugfix for recursive reverts - missing intermediate directories caused 
	fsvs to stop, and meta-data was not correctly applied.
	Fixed full recursive reverts of whole trees.
- diff now prints the "Only in local filesystem" messages only with -v, and 
	ignored files are ignored.
- Master/Local test, and commit_to option.

Changes since 1.1.7
- "fsvs checkout" - a combination of "fsvs urls" and "fsvs update".
- "softroot" option, used for recovery.
- "fsvs help" had a small bug in terminal width calculation
- Fix for action name matching; a string identical to some compare value is 
	now an exact match, no ifs or elses.
- Bugfix for the options; the priority was not correctly set, so in certain
  cases the wrong option value would be used.
- Bugfix for chroot jail - the locale was be taken from the real root 
	directory, where it was most likely incompatible.
- The log output is colorized per default (on TTYs); done via ANSI 
	sequences, as ncurses made some problems.
	The log messages can now be indented, too.
- Other small bugfixes

Changes since 1.1.6
- "fsvs log"
- Changed the format for warnings.
- Bugfix for revert: a removed directory would not be re-created.
- Bugfix plus enhancement: Allowing "-rREV" for revert, with a warning.
	The status characters now show the status against BASE.
- "configure.in" (and with it configure) has been moved to the parent 
	directory; a small Makefile is there, too. Seems to be more standard to 
	have that structure.
- Moved the test-directory up, too.
- The default for the path printing is now parameter-relative.
- The environment variable "FSVS_DIFF" has been renamed to "FSVS_DIFF_PRG".
	New options for the diff procedure.
- Filter option, the same as "-f".
- -v now lets warnings print their identification string.
- New way of testing parts of the program - calling functions through gdb
- The translation user/group name => id now uses a cache.
- A commit of parts of a working copy root now set the check flag for 
	encountered directories that have *not* been fully committed.
	So a commit of "a/b/c" now shows the new entry "a/j", although the 
	timestamp of "a" has been set during the commit.
- Warning actions are now settable via options, and they are better 
	documented.
- Small bugfixes and cleanups.

Changes since 1.1.5
- Diff exit status is now a warning, per default ignored.
  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2007-06/msg00114.html
- Some cleanups; the various internal caches are done via cache.c.
- Bugfix for the case that a parameter is *exactly* a wc root.
- Cleanups for the actions update, remote-status and sync-repos (and 
	_build-new-list) - interpretation of the single path-parameter.
- A verbose version call ("-v -V") now gives the compile options, too.
- Support for configuration files.

Changes since 1.1.4
- configure now fails if gdbm or pcre are not found.
- Option for path display settings.
- If no path arguments are given, the current directory is taken as the 
	implicit parameter.
- For new, added and unversioned entries no other flags than those are 
	printed on "fsvs status" - they're kind of irrelevant, as they're implied.
- The WAA has been splitted into two areas.
- The environment variable WAA was renamed to FSVS_WAA.
- New environment variable FSVS_CONF.
- Diff now knows "-v" for additional meta-data diff.
- Some cleanups and small bugfixes.
- A changed ctime is no longer seen as meta-data change - it's only an 
	indicator for *possible* changes.
- New parameter -f for filtering entries.


Changes since 1.1.3
- New and replaced entries now consistently have *only* the "N" flag - as 
	the meta-data *has* to change.
	Meta-data changes coming from the repository have now correct markings.
- Bugfix for filenames starting with a space. sscanf() would skip over the 
	space, and the empty name would confuse fsvs.
- User interface enhancements; messages are no longer printed with "An 
	error occurred". A few other small changes in output were done, too.
- Bugfix for ignore patterns with brackets "[]".
- Bugfixes for commit - tell meta-data changes correctly, and don't send 
	the fulltext if only meta-data has changed.
- Some documentation update.
- Corrected the handling of entries given on the command line - show 
	information for deleted, too. Better checking if an entry has to exist.
- "fsvs info" now uses the conventional way to use the arguments, and so
	understands -R.
- Bugfix for "fsvs status" - if no commit has happened, we should 
	nonetheless provide status output.
- If we're near the 100% mark on the progress report, don't show it.
	We'd get some time with always 99,9% when committing a big, new tree.
- Bugfix for enumeration of more than one child of the root directory.
	Ie. "fsvs status /etc /bin" gave an error.
- "fsvs info" now gives the number of known children.
- Some code cleanups.

Changes since 1.1.2.
- FSVS_DEBUGLEVEL can be set (to eg. 1) to enable the debug output. The 
	same as with -d, but doesn't change the commandline, and allows early 
	debugging.
- With "configure --with-chroot={path}" a chroot helper program is 
	compiled. fsvs got a function to preload all necessary libraries in the 
	chroot jail before returning into the "normal" filesystem.
- Implemented (non-)recursive diff.
- The diff action now does a cleanup on SIGINT.
- Diffs now include the header line "diff -u ...".

Changes since 1.1.1.
- "proplist" showed the \0 at the end of key and value.
- "fsvs revert" was a little bit re-written.
- Major new feature: Recursive/non-recursive operations -- revert, status, 
	commit.
- Bugfix for diff: when an fsvs:update-pipe changed, the wrong decoder was 
	be used.
- Some cleanups. Eg. splitted the flags parameter of ops__traverse().
- Still more doxygen documentation.

Changes since 1.1.0.
- Shell ignore patterns have changed - they now understand character 
	classes and escaped characters, and they are anchored at the end, too.  
	See the documentation.
- For older changes please see
	http://fsvs.tigris.org/source/browse/fsvs/tags/fsvs-1.1.0/fsvs/CHANGES?rev=725&view=markup
- Bugfix for "fsvs info $WC" -- didn't find the working copy.
- Allow arbitrary properties to be stored locally, and to be sent to the
	repository on commit.
- Arbitrary property support: store them locally, provide commands for 
	editing, and retrieve/store them from/in the repository.
- Special property "fsvs:commit-pipe" - for eg. encrypted backups
- Special property "fsvs:update-pipe" - for automatic decryption
- Make url__parse() accept a target revision, and store it persistent.
	Made it dumpable.
- Bugfix for valgrind usage.
- Bugfix for some weird /.././.././ constructions on the commandline,
	test for that.
- Fixed a memory leak.
- Some cleanups.
