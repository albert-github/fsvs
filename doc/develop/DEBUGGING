Dear developers/debuggers,


thank you for your interest in fsvs.

I highly appreciate any help, tips and tricks, and even if it's just
a bug report I want to know that.
I'm also looking forward to documentation updates, and notifying me about
mistakes will be politely answered, too.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ What to do in case of errors
First, please read the documentation to rule out the possibility that
it's just a badly written sentence that caused misunderstanding.

If you can't figure it out yourself, don't hesitate and write a bug report.
Please include the version you're running, the command line you're calling 
fsvs with, and the output it gives your for these cases:
- The command you wanted to run
- With the -v parameter (verbose)
- and with -d (debug)

Send these things along with a description of what you wanted to do to
	dev@fsvs.tigris.org
or, if you like that alternative better, just file an issue.
(The bugs I find and the things on my TODO are not in the issue tracker,
as I can't access it while on the train - and that's where I spend the most
time working on fsvs).

Please be aware that I possibly need more details or some other tries to
find out what goes wrong.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ People that like to help
If you know C and want to help with fsvs, Just Do It (R) :-)
Look into the TODO file, pick your favorite point, and implement it.

If you don't know C, but another programming language (like perl, python, 
or shell-programming), you can help, too.
Please write test scripts.
I mostly checked the positive behavior (ie. that something should happen
given a set of predefined state and parameters), but testing for wrong and
unexpected input makes sense, too.

If you don't know any programming language, you can still look at the 
documentation and point me to parts which need clarifying, write documents
yourself, or just fix mistakes.


All contributions should *please* be sent as a unified diff, along with 
a description of the change, and there's a good chance to have it 
integrated into the fsvs code-base.

-- How to generate such a diff?
If you're using svn or svk to track fsvs usage, the "svn diff" or "svk diff"
commands should do what you want.

If you downloaded a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2, keep a pristine version in another 
directory (eg. fsvs-1.0.5.orig/), and make your changes in another copy
(eg fsvs-1.0.5/).
When you're finished making changes, run the command
	diff -ur fsvs-1.0.5.orig fsvs-1.0.5 > my-changes.patch
and send me that file.
