Description: Full system versioning with metadata support
 FSVS is a backup/restore/versioning/deployment tool for whole directory
 trees or filesystems, with a Subversion repository as the backend.
 It can do overlays of multiple repositories, to achieve some content
 separation (base install, local modifications, etc.)
