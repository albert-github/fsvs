This is an example setup for versioning /etc in 
debian-based systems.

         --- NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND ---

BEWARE! You might end up putting configuration files,
that should be kept secret, into the repository!
I defined filtering for the few I know - but you'd 
better check yourself!

If you want to see the fruits of your versioning efforts,
put yourself into the sysver group, and use subcommander
or any other GUI you like.

TODO: Write some better documentation.
