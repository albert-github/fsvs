     -) Full System VerSioning

Q: Why are the listings not sorted?
A: Because of speed considerations the program does the files in
   hard disk-order, ie. in the order they're on the hard disk.
   Doing the run and output later would leave the user without feedback
   for some time.

Q: What meta-data is versioned?
A: Currently modification time, user, group, and permissions are saved.

Q: What kind of files are versioned?
A: Files, directories, device nodes (block and char), symbolic links.
   Sockets and pipes are normally regenerated upon opening and are therefore
   not stored.

Q: I don't like XYZ.
A: Unified patches are welcome.

Q: Why is it called fsvs and not X?
A: I've had several great ideas myself, but after discarding SYSV
   (SYStem Versioning) and SUBS (SUbversion Backup System) I just searched
   for a unique string to describe this project.

Q: Can I use some subdirectory of my repository instead of the root?
A: Of course. You can use the normal subversion structures /trunk, /tags,
   /branches - you just have to create them and point your working copy there.
	 So you do
	    svn mkdir $URL/branches $URL/tags $URL/trunk
	 and use
	    fsvs init $URL/trunk
	 to use the trunk, or
	    fsvs export $URL/tags/tag2
	 to export your "tag2".
	 Note: There's no way currently to "switch" between directories, although
	 there might/should.
